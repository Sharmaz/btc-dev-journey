# Intro

First of all, I must confess that I am starting out in this world of developing applications for **Bitcoin** and **Lightning Network**.

The reason why this project exists is because I had setbacks from the initial setup, because the official documentation is a bit confusing, complex and in some parts outdated.

Here I will add several guides, tutorials and more information regarding the development of applications on Bitcoin and Lightning Network. These resources will be available in **English** and **Spanish**.

To be able to follow these guides without problems you must have some experience as a developer.

However, this does not mean that you will not achieve success by following these guides, you can support yourself with tools such as Chat GPT, search engines or by asking in forums such as reddit/stackoverflow or similar.

If you want to contribute to this project, you can do so in the GitHub repository [https://github.com/Sharmaz/btc-dev-journey](https://github.com/Sharmaz/btc-dev-journey).
