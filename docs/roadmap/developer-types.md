# Types of Bitcoin Developers

Bitcoin development spans a wide range of disciplines. This roadmap organizes them into four tracks, each with its own skills, tools, and career paths.

## Protocol Developer

**What you do:** Work on Bitcoin's core protocol — the consensus rules, peer-to-peer networking, transaction validation, and the codebase that runs every full node on the network.

**Key skills:**
- C++ (Bitcoin Core's primary language)
- Cryptography and consensus algorithms
- Understanding of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals)
- Code review and testing methodologies

**You might work on:**
- Bitcoin Core contributions
- Consensus rule changes
- Peer-to-peer protocol improvements
- Signature schemes and script enhancements

---

## Application Developer

**What you do:** Build user-facing applications that interact with the Bitcoin network — wallets, payment systems, exchanges, and tools that make Bitcoin accessible to end users.

**Key skills:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, or Go
- Bitcoin libraries and SDKs (bitcoinjs-lib, python-bitcoinlib, BDK, LDK)
- Wallet architecture (HD wallets, BIP-32/39/44)
- Payment processing and Lightning Network integration

**You might work on:**
- Desktop, mobile, or web wallets
- Payment gateways and point-of-sale systems
- Exchanges and trading platforms
- Lightning Network applications

---

## Infrastructure Developer

**What you do:** Build and maintain the backend systems that power the Bitcoin ecosystem — block explorers, indexing services, APIs, and node infrastructure at scale.

**Key skills:**
- Backend development and databases
- Distributed systems and DevOps
- Blockchain data indexing and querying
- API design and high-availability systems

**You might work on:**
- Block explorers (like Mempool.space)
- Blockchain indexers and data pipelines
- Public APIs for Bitcoin data
- Node hosting and monitoring infrastructure

---

## Mining Developer

**What you do:** Develop software for Bitcoin mining operations — pool software, firmware for mining hardware, stratum protocol implementations, and performance optimization.

**Key skills:**
- Low-level programming (C, Rust)
- Networking protocols (Stratum V1/V2)
- Hardware interfaces and embedded systems
- Performance optimization and profiling

**You might work on:**
- Mining pool software
- ASIC firmware and optimization
- Stratum protocol implementations
- Mining analytics and monitoring tools

---

## Which Track Should I Choose?

There's no wrong answer. Consider:

- **If you love low-level systems and cryptography** → Protocol Developer
- **If you want to build products people use** → Application Developer
- **If you enjoy backend systems and data** → Infrastructure Developer
- **If you're interested in hardware and optimization** → Mining Developer

Many developers work across multiple tracks. The fundamentals are shared, so you can always pivot later.
