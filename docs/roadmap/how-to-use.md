# How to Use This Roadmap

## Structure

The roadmap is divided into two main sections:

### Universal Fundamentals

These are the topics every Bitcoin developer needs to understand, regardless of specialization. They are organized in a suggested learning order:

1. **Prerequisites** — Programming, math, and systems knowledge you should have before diving into Bitcoin
2. **Bitcoin Fundamentals** — History, philosophy, and core cryptographic concepts
3. **Bitcoin Architecture** — The UTXO model, transactions, and Bitcoin Script
4. **P2P Network** — How nodes communicate and the network protocol
5. **Basic Development** — Setting up a node, understanding networks (mainnet/testnet/regtest), and basic wallet operations

### Specialization Tracks

After completing the fundamentals, choose one (or more) tracks:

- **Protocol Developer** — Work on Bitcoin Core itself, consensus mechanisms, and protocol improvements
- **Application Developer** — Build applications on top of Bitcoin: wallets, payment processors, exchanges
- **Infrastructure Developer** — Create the tools and services the ecosystem depends on: explorers, indexers, APIs
- **Mining Developer** — Develop mining software, pool infrastructure, and hardware optimization

## Tips

- **Don't rush the fundamentals.** A strong foundation makes specialization much easier.
- **Practice as you learn.** Each section includes practical exercises and project suggestions.
- **Use regtest for experiments.** The regtest network lets you mine blocks instantly and test without real funds.
- **Refer to primary sources.** We link to BIPs, Bitcoin Core source code, and official documentation wherever possible.
- **Join the community.** Bitcoin development is collaborative — ask questions, review code, and share what you learn.
