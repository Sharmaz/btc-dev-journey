## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Start with Fundamentals** — Everyone begins with the same universal foundations: prerequisites, Bitcoin basics, architecture, P2P networking, and basic development
2. **Choose Your Track** — Once you have a solid foundation, pick the specialization that excites you most
3. **Go Deep** — Each track has its own progression from beginner to advanced topics
4. **Cross-Pollinate** — Many concepts overlap between tracks, so explore freely

## Specialization Tracks

| Track | Focus | You'll Build |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Protocol Developer** | Bitcoin Core internals, consensus, BIPs | Core contributions, protocol improvements |
| **Application Developer** | Libraries, wallets, payment systems | Wallets, payment processors, exchanges |
| **Infrastructure Developer** | Block explorers, indexers, APIs | Explorers, analytics platforms, node infrastructure |
| **Mining Developer** | Mining software, pools, hardware | Mining pools, firmware, optimization tools |
